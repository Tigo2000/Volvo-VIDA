### Setup:
- Volvo C30 T5 2008
- VIDA 2014D running on Windows 7
- VIDA databases running in a MSSQL Docker container for easier PowerShell access
- DICE CANBus sniffer
- Raspberry Pi + MCP2515 CAN Interface

## Volvo VIDA Reverse engineering
As VIDA is able to diagnose cars without an internet connection, all the data needed for this communication is presumably stored locally, alongside VIDA itself. A prime candidate for this storage is MSSQL. In `C:\Vida\`, there's a file called "VidaConfigApplication.Exe.Config", which contains the following SQL credentials:

```
DBUser: sa
DBPass: GunnarS3g3
```

Using these credentials, you can open the SQL databases using something like Microsoft SQL Management Studio. The most important databases are `carcom` and `DiagSwdlRepository`, these contain information that we are most interested in. As the name would suggest, the carcom database (probably) contains all the car-information that VIDA uses to communicate with any connected vehicles. Some of the most important tables are:

- T100_EcuVariant
- T141_Block
- T144_BlockChild
- T150_Blockvalue
- T191_TextData  

All the databases also contain SQL 'Stored Procedures' and (table) Functions. These procedures are called from VIDA, and contain certain steps to retrieve information from the different SQL databases and tables. For example, when a car is selected on the Vehicle Profile screen in VIDA, the stored procedure GetCompatibleProfiles from the CarCom database is executed. The GetCompatibleProfiles procedure consists of a SQL query to select the vehicle-model, year, engine, transmission, steering config, market etc. Subsequently clicking on 'Diagnostics' calls the procedure 'GetEcuTypeDescriptions', where all the ECUs (for the vehicle selected in Vehicle Profile) are retrieved. That query looks like: `SELECT DISTINCT identifier, description from T102_EcuType WHERE identifier <> 0`. The steps for every single action performed in VIDA can be found in these procedures.

With the information in these procedures and functions, I was able to make some queries myself (which can be found in this repo) that can be used to easily select the ECU identifiers and hex values to retrieve ecu-related data from my car. Below some examples which you can retrieve from your vehicle using these CAN-values:

**ECM:** 
- A/C Pressure
- Boost Pressure
- Lambda sensor readings
- Engine speed (RPM)
- Vehicle speed

**BCM:** 
- Yaw sensor 
- Velocity of car
- Acceleration of each wheel in m/sÂ²

**DIM:** 
- Fuel level
- Hours since last service

This is just a short list and does not include every single parameter you could request from the vehicle. The ECM alone has 250+ rows of parameters for example.

### Storage 
To keep the necessary storage of VIDA down, the developers opted to compress images, scripts, etc and store them as hex-strings in the SQL databases. We can take this hexstring, remove the `0x` at the front and write the remaining bytes directly to a file. In case of images, giving this file the correct extension (like jpg) makes it a valid image right away. Multiple image formats are used:
- JPEG
- GIF
- CGM
- SVG
- JPG 

Exporting Scripts is a bit more involved. The content of the files is again stored as a hexstring in the database `[DiagSwdlRepository].[dbo].ScriptContent` -> column `XMLDataCompressed`. Writing the raw bytes to a file, a zip file is revealed. After unzipping this archive a single file is stored within, which is an XML file. What the scripts are used for exactly, is currently unknown. Most of the parameter values do not line up with the values I retrieved from the SQL databases itself.

The documents which can be found under the information tab (Parts catalog, repair, installation instructions, specifications, etc) are also stored as compressed XML in SQL. These can be exported the same way as the scripts above. In the exported XML files, there are references to images and text, which VIDA uses to create the pages you can see.      


### VIDA Diagnostic log

After prying around more in the VIDA files, I found a diagnostic-log which stores pretty much all user-actions that are performed on the Vehicle Profile and Car Communication pages. As an example, below you can see the log which is generated when VIDA is started, a vehicle profile has been selected and the user navigated to Diagnostics -> Vehicle Communication -> Select ECM -> Expand ECM. I've marked interesting information in bold.

As you can see, when VIDA is started and you select the correct vehicle profile / VIN, VIDA uses that profile to get the vehicle (nav) image, a profile, default ECU descriptions etc. Using this EcuID, it will provide a list of parameters using the stored procedure (SP): general_GetEcuID. The ID returned is *1310*, which corresponds to default diagnostic (ecu) number: *31211150 AA* according to `[carcom].[dbo].EcuVariant`. Below you can see how VIDA gets the selected parameter, Boost Pressure as an example, using a stored procedure. 
 
#### Selecting parameter on Vehicle Communication page
> 16:51:39,232 [CarComRepository][001][Event]   Database: CarCom, SP: vadis_GetParameterData, EcuId: 1310, TextId: 5249, Id: **129D**<br>
> 16.51.39,247 [ScriptProvider][001][Event]   Database:  DiagSwdlRepository, SP: GetValidLinksForSelected<br>

The Stored Procedure `vadis_GetParameterData` returns the text `PVDKDS : Pressure in front of throttle valve of pressure sensor` and `Boost Pressure` as a shorter name, and most importantly the hex value 0x12, 0x9D. Using this hex value in a Diagnostic CAN request, the current boost pressure will be returned by the ECM.

To recap:
- Database: CarCom
- Stored Procedure: vadis_GetParameterData
- EcuID: 1310 (31211150 AA)
- TextID: 5249 (`SELECT * FROM [carcom].[dbo].[T191_TextData] where fkT190_Text = '5249'` returns Boost Pressure in 17 languages)
- Id: 129D (Hex parameter value)

The file `Get-ParameterDataUsingEcuAndTextId.sql` in this repo is very similar to this specific Stored Procedure. The file `Get-CANValuesUsingEcuId.sql` retrieves all parameters for a given ECU. Both of these SQL-queries also add the RequestType and the conversion factor.

## CAN messages
The Volvo VIDA diagnostic protocol is similar to UDS, but with notable differences. In VIDA, the first byte represents the DLC (Data Length Code), while the second byte represents the ECU address.

**Request:**  
ID: `0x000FFFFE` Data: `CD 7A A6 12 9D 01 00 00`
- 0x000FFFFE is the CAN diagnostic address
- CD is C8 + number of significant bytes to follow.
- 7A is the address of the ME7 ECU (ECM)
- A6 is the "Read Current Data By Identifier" command
- 12,9D is the Boost Pressure parameter
- 01 is probably "Send the record once"
- 00s are padding the rest of the frame to keep it 8 bytes long

**Response:**  
ID `0x00400021` Data: `CD 7A E6 12 9D 95 00 00`
- 00400021 is the CAN address for response for this particular ECU
- CD is C8 + number of significant bytes to follow.
- 7A is the address of the ME7 ECU
- E6 is response to A6
- 12,9D is confirming the request parameter
- 95 is the return value
- 00s are padding

More information on this can be found in Alfaa123's Volvo-CAN-Gauge repository and in waal70's blogposts.

There are more commands besides `A6`. The requestType returned in the earlier SQL queries, correspond to these commands. `A6` is Read Current Data by Identifier, which corresponds to the 'REID' (Request Extended ID (by Identifier)?) requestType. A different command is `AE`, which is 'Read DTC'. Sending this command to a ECU makes it spit out any stored DTC codes (if any). A list of all commands can be found in `ECU-commands.txt` in this repo. 

With the CAN values exported from VIDA using the scripts in this repo, we can easily retrieve a ton of information from the different ECUs in our car. Some examples:

<details open>
    <summary>(ECM) Battery Voltage</summary> 

```
    Request: 0x000FFFFE CD 7A A6 10 0A 01 00 00
    Response: 0x00400021 CD 7A E6 10 0A 96 00 00 
        
    Hex return value: 96
```
</details> 

<details>
    <summary>(DIM) Total Fuel Level</summary> 

```
    Request: 0x000FFFFE CD 51 A6 00 01 01 00 00
    Response: 0x00600009 CD 51 E6 00 01 6A 00 00 
        
    Hex return value: 6A
```
</details> 

<details>
    <summary>(DIM) Hours since Service</summary> 

```
    Request: 0x000FFFFE CD 51 B9 07 00 00 00 00
    Response: 0x00600009 F9 51 F9 00 D9 00 00 00
        
    Hex return value: D9
```
</details>

As seen above, the Response ID for every ECU is different. Also, the command `B9` (Read Data Block By Offset) returns its response in message byte 5 instead of 6 (command A6). The responses are all in hex, so these have to be converted to decimal.

The response values are also not in the correct unit yet and do not have the correct scaling applied. This is where the Conversion Factor comes in to play. In the exported Parameter data, it shows the unit of the final response and a mathematical calculation how to scale the response correctly. For the above parameters:

- (ECM) Battery Voltage: `x * 1 / 10.6113989637306` -> `150 * 1 / 10.6113989637306` = 14.14 Volts
- (DIM) Total Fuel Level: `x / 2` -> `106 / 2` = 53 Litres
- (DIM) Hours since Service: `x * 1` -> `217 * 1` = 217 Hours

Not all ECUs in a vehicle are connected to the same CAN-bus. For example, the ECM in my car runs at 500kbps (high speed), whereas the DIM (Driver Information Module, gauge cluster) only responds to CAN messages sent on the 125kbps bus. (low speed) An overview of which ECU is connected to which CAN-bus can be found in VIDA.       

### CAN-bus sniffing
When I started this project, I used a canbus sniffer to retrieve information from the car. This worked but it took a lot of time, mostly because it's not directly obvious which CAN-message is associated with a certain function in the car. Having found all the ECU parameters data in SQL, I have not needed to sniff for messages on the bus anymore.

### Getting the address/IDs of an ECU
The addresses of some ECUs are known (like the ME7 ECU in my car), but for other engines the ID is not known yet. If you connect your car to VIDA and dump the table `[DiagSwdlSession].[dbo].[EcuInfo]`, you will see the ECU address (in decimal). In the case of the ME7 ECM the Address is `122`, which would be `7A` in hexadecimal. This is the target address you would use to send requests to this particular ECU.

In case you do not have VIDA and a DICE cable, you could try to brute-force the device IDs with the provided Python script in this repo on for example a Raspberry Pi and a CAN transceiver like a MCP2515, or a CarPiHAT. The script will loop through all possible device/target-id's (`0x00` to `0xFF`), and it will request the Diagnostic Trouble Codes from each device. Once all possible device IDs have been checked, the script will stop and show the list of active devices.

As an example, the script returns:

```
Devices found!  
Device ID: 29, Response ID: 00601001  
Device ID: 54, Response ID: 00604001  
```

Once you have the target IDs of all the devices in your car, you can send an actual CAN message request with a request parameter and listen for a response using the response ID. This way you will be able to match the device ID with a particular ECU in the car. It would look something like this:

> cansend can0 000FFFFE#CD29A61C0401000  

Here's a breakdown of this message:

**Request:**  
ID: `0x000FFFFE` Data: `CD 29 A6 1C 04 01 00 00`
- 0x000FFFFE is the CAN diagnostic address
- `CD` is `C8` + number of significant bytes to follow.
- `29` is the address of an ECU found by the brute-force script 
- `A6` is the "Read Current Data By Identifier" command
- `1C 04` is a request parameter exported using a PowerShell script which is unique to the ICM.
- `01` is probably "Send the record once"
- 00s are padding the rest of the frame to keep it 8 bytes long

There will likely only be one device that will respond to this request even though you send it to all devices, as it is the only ECU which has this request parameter. With this method, it will take a bit of effort to figure out which device is which. 

## Scripts
Below you can find more information about the PowerShell scripts in this repo and how to use them.

All scripts have been tested in PowerShell Version 5.1 and can be used in VS Code, or from the deprecated PowerShell ISE. The scripts ask for the SQL credentials on first-run, these can be found above. Some scripts might also ask to enter an export path, or ask for a path to certain files. Make sure that the path you enter exist, otherwise exporting or reading data will fail. You can stop execution of a script by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

**Parameters**<br>
Using the script `Get-ParametersForAllECUs.ps1`, all ECU Parameters for a given car/model can be exported. These ECU Identifiers contain data that can subsequently be sent on the CAN-bus to retrieve engine related information, like boost pressure, intake temperature, etc. The results are exported to multiple CSV files.

**Images**<br>
The script `Export-VidaPictures.ps1` exports all (compressed) pictures in VIDA to their respective file extension. This script can take a couple of minutes to finish. Should return ~92692 pictures, just under 3GB in total. 

**Scripts**<br>
In my experience, the parameter values that the VIDA-Scripts returned did not match the expected values but I might be missing something. As the parameter values (exported using `Get-ParametersForAllECUs.ps1`) did return the correct values, I had no reason to look into the scripts anymore. There might still be some interesting info there, so the PowerShell scripts to export the scripts and parse them, is still provided:

The script `Export-ScriptsToXML.ps1` prompts to enter a vehicle model (like: C30), and then exports all the VIDA-Scripts for that model (all model years) to a certain path (like C:\temp\export). If you want to export just one model year, enter "C30 2008".

With the scripts `Parse/Search-XMLFiles.ps1`, you can easily search through the exported scripts.
